/*

The Purpose of this project is to connect front-end with backend.

In this project we will 

- send requests to our own server & db 
- authenticate users 
- save token in front 
- send tokens to the server 
- re-route depending on access and verification 

and more 

This project is connected to our master-cheat-sheet-backend project 

    - the master project receives users and tweets 


The theory folder will hold the instructions on how we build the project but the actuall implementation of the theory will be held in the first 3 files 

This is because we cannot re-set the project for any new lesson we learn
